## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v18` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd disinfectant-frontend
nvm use
```

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services are given access to a namespaced prefixed that matches the service name. e.g. `my-service` will have access to everything in Redis that is prefixed with `my-service`.

Redis has been **disabled** in newly created services by setting the `redis.enabled` property to `false`. The CDP platform team have to inject Redis configuration into your service first. Your service will death-loop if Redis is enabled without speaking to us first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If enabling Redis, contact the CDP Platform Team first. Deploying your service with Redis enabled, before we've injected Redis configuration will cause your service to death-loop.

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. Specifically CatboxRedis, the Redis adapter for CatBox. It is important that in memory caching isn't used for server-side caching as this will cause issues when there is more than one instance of your service running. Server-side caching has been **disabled** in newly created services by setting the `redis.enabled` property to `false`. Please see [Redis](#redis) for more information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to enable server-side caching using Catbox, contact the CDP Platform Team first. Deploying your service with Redis enabled, before we've injected Redis configuration will cause your service to death-loop.

## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Local JSON API

Whilst the APIs are being developed this app uses a local JSON mock API. To start this locally run:

```bash
npm run mockApi
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

## Docker

### Development image

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag disinfectant-frontend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 disinfectant-frontend:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag disinfectant-frontend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 disinfectant-frontend
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out backend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
